* I studied how donors respond to merit and need when giving to families facing unaffordable medical expenses.
* Crowdfunding campaigns receive much more donations if patients or fundraisers report attending (selective) colleges.
* At the transaction level, a serial donor favors patients who attend a higher-ranked college or have a postgraduate degree.
* To control for campaign and writing characteristics, novel NLP techniques are employed to extract information from fundraising text
* An online survey experiment is conducted to elicit respondents’ willingness to donate to synthetic fundraising stories, in which the patients’ college and medical expenses are independently randomized. Both academic merit and financial need enhance donor generosity.
* In line with limited knowledge of college ranking, the effect on college rankings is more pronounced for top and in-province institutions.
* Merit help attract donation, probably by amplifying the warm glow effect.
