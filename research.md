* I studied how donors respond to merit and need when giving to families facing unaffordable medical expenses.
* Crowdfunding campaigns receive much more donations if patients or fundraisers report attending (selective) colleges.
* At the transaction level, a serial donor favors patients who attend a higher-ranked college or have a postgraduate degree.
* To control for campaign and writing characteristics, novel NLP techniques are employed to extract information from fundraising text
* An online survey experiment is conducted to elicit respondents’ willingness to donate to synthetic fundraising stories, in which the patients’ college and medical expenses are independently randomized. Both academic merit and financial need enhance donor generosity.
* In line with limited knowledge of college ranking, the effect on college rankings is more pronounced for top and in-province institutions.
* Merit help attract donation, probably by amplifying the warm glow effect.

* Collected a large dataset of official (red-header) documents in China
* Identified policies from document topics classified by BERT
* Depicted the patterns of policy creation and diffusion
* Associated the patterns with regional development characteristics and promotion incentives of local leaders

## The Economic Impact of Closing Illicit Markets:<br> Evidence from China’s Crackdown on Prostitution
___
*Joint with Songjun Jiang*

* Using synthetic control methods, we estimated the economic impact of a crackdown on prostitution in Dongguan. 
* Tourism suffered a major blow due to the removal of the sex industry and increased law enforcement
* As collateral damage, we document a reduction in entertainment consumption for local households by a diff-in-diff strategy
* Using a spatial diff-in-diff, we explore its economic impact at the block level

## Ballot Order Effect without (Open) Election 
___
<br>
I documented that Chinese officials with fewer strokes in the family name, and thus with the name appearing early in a roster, are overrepresented at the top leadership body(central committee). The overrepresentation relative to the population (and to the top scientists) is largely driven by names with the fewest 24% strokes (≤ 6 strokes) and is more pronounced for names with fewer strokes. A minor effect is found for less powerful members of the NPC and CPPCC. This roster order effect suggests limited attention of officials in charge of appointment or involved in the party's personnel selection process. The advantage of name order in politicians' career advancement is not unique to open elections.
